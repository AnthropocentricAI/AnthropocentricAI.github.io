CircleCI integration and configuration file setup.<!--more-->

## CircleCI Setup ##
1. Login with GitHub account to [CircleCI](htps://circleci.com)
2. Select "Add Project"
3. Ensure that GitHub project has a Circle CI configuration file `.circleci/config.yaml`
4. Click "Start Building"

## config.yaml ##
Documentation for setting up Circle CI 2.0 configuration files can be found [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-python/). 
The workflow section will define which jobs you would like to run.

The overall structure is as follows. You can define a number of `jobs` and then specify which jobs to run in the `workflows` section. An example can be found below.
```yaml
version: 2    # use version 2.0 of CircleCI
workflows:
  version:2
  test:    # Define jobs that are to be ran here
    jobs:
      - test-3.7
jobs:    # Define all jobs here
  test-3.7:
     # EXAMPLE JOB
```

### Docker file ###
Each job should consist of a Docker image to use hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). CirlceCI provides their own docker images [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/). Custom images can also be uploaded to Docker Hub and used.

### Cache Dependencies ###
Dependencies can be cached with `save_cache` step and can be saved in different locations for each jobs (for example using different versions of python requires different dependencies). The dependencies can then be loaded in step `restore_cache` whilst specifying the key for the dependencies you would like to load. The checksum is to check if there are any additional dependencies to be install specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Running the tests ###
After activating the environment needed for testing, tests can be ran with `pytest` whilst specifying an output in any format supported by `pytest`.

### Example job ###
Below is an example script for a job called `test-3.7`.
{% raw %}
```yaml
test-3.7:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7    # Docker image that CircleCI update
    working_directory: ~/repo    # Change working directory to repo directory
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:    # Load previously cached dependencies
          keys:
          - v1-py37-dependencies-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
          - v1-py37-dependencies-
      - run:
          name: install dependencies
          command: |
            python -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install -e .
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - ./venv
          key: v1-py37-dependencies-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
      - run:
          name: run tests
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            py.test --junit-xml=./fatf/tests/report37.xml
      - store_test_results:
          path: ./fatf/tests
```
{% endraw %}

## Template Jobs ##
Template jobs can be used where only a few lines change per job. Below is an example of defining a default job called `test-3.7`. Another job is defined as `test-3.6` that uses the template but overrides the docker image to a version of python 3.6. However, in this example the dependency directories and virtual environments remind unchanged.
{% raw %}
```yaml
version: 2
workflows:
  version:2
  test:
    jobs:
      - test-3.7
      - test-3.6
jobs:
  test-3.7: &test-template    # Define this template as test-template
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
          - v1-py37-dependencies-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
          - v1-py37-dependencies-
      - run:
          name: install dependencies
          command: |
            python -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install -e .
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - ./venv
          key: v1-py37-dependencies-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
      - run:
          name: run tests
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            py.test --junit-xml=./fatf/tests/report37.xml
      - store_test_results:
          path: ./fatf/tests
  test-3.6:
    <<: *test-template    # Use template defined previously called test-template
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.6    # Change one line of the test-template to use a different docker image
```
{% endraw %}
