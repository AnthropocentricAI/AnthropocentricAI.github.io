Continuous integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org). <!--more-->
## [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) CI ##
The continuous integration build configuration with Travis is located inside the `.travis.yml` file. To enable Travis, head over to their [website](https://travis-ci.org), sign in with GitHub and authorise the webhook. This will take you to their main page where you need to toggle the switch next to the desired repositatory.

### [Environment Variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) in Travis ###

For sensitive data, such as the codecov token, environment variables can be stored at the repository settings and clicking on “Add new variable” in the “Environment Variables” section on [Travis' website](https://travis-ci.org). Environment varibles are access in the normal way using `$VAR_NAME`.

### [Codecov](codecov.io) with Travis ###
After a successful build, the xml code coverage report is send in the yaml file by 
```
after_success:
  - codecov
```
This is for public repositories only, for private repositories you need to use
```
after_success:
  - codecov -t [the_repository_upload_token]
```
To obtain the repository upload token, head over to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) and log in with GitHub. Click "Add a repository". Select the repository and this will display the upload token.

### Containers ###
 The different python build jobs are located in the .travis.yml file under
```
language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
  - "3.6"
  - "3.7-dev" 
```
Where each item is a separate EC2 container, with the specified version of Python.
