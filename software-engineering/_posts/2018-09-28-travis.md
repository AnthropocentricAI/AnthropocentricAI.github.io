Setting up continuous integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org). <!--more-->

## Travis CI ##
The continuous integration build configuration with Travis is located inside the `.travis.yml` file. To enable Travis, head over to their [website](https://travis-ci.org), sign in with GitHub and authorise the webhook. This will take you to their main page where you need to toggle the switch next to the desired repositatory.

### Environment Variables in Travis ###
For sensitive data, such as the `codecov` token, [environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) can be stored in the Travis repository settings by clicking on "Add new variable" in the "Environment Variables" section on [Travis' website](https://travis-ci.org). Environment variables can accessed in the usual way by using `$VAR_NAME`.

### Codecov with Travis ###
After a successful build, the `xml` code coverage report can be send in a `yaml` file by with
```
after_success:
  - codecov
```

This is for public repositories only, for private repositories you need to use
```
after_success:
  - codecov -t [the_repository_upload_token]
```

To obtain the token, head over to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) and log in with your GitHub credentials, click "Add a repository" and select a repository which will display an upload token.

### Containers ###
 The different python build jobs are located in the `.travis.yml` file under
```
language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
  - "3.6"
  - "3.7-dev"
```

Where each item is a separate EC2 container, with the specified version of Python.
